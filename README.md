# Running the React Application

This document provides instructions for setting up and running the React application locally.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (includes npm, which is required for managing packages).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the React application:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository that contains the React application source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhaysharma136/upraised-test-app.git
cd upraised-test-app
 Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm:

bash
Copy code
npm install
3. Set Up Environment Variables
This application requires environment variables. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project.

Note: The .env file is not included in the repository for security reasons. You will need to create this file with the necessary environment variables as required by the application.

4. Run the Application
Start the development server to run the React application locally:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This command starts the development server and opens the application in your default web browser. By default, it should be accessible at:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:3000
5. Building for Production
To create a production build of the application, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
This command generates static files for the production build in the build directory. You can then deploy these files to a web server.

Additional Notes
Updating the Application: If you make changes to the application, simply restart the development server with npm start to see the updates.

Code Style and Formatting: Follow the coding guidelines specified in the projectâ€™s documentation or contributing guidelines.
