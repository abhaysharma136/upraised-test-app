Running the React Application
This document provides instructions for setting up and running the React application locally.

Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js: Download and install Node.js (includes npm, which is required for managing packages).
Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the React application:

1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the repository that contains the React application source code:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
Replace <repository_url> with the URL of the repository and <repository_name> with the name of the repository directory.

2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm:

bash
Copy code
npm install
This command installs all the packages listed in the package.json file.

3. Set Up Environment Variables
If your application requires environment variables, create a .env file in the root directory of the project. The .env file should contain any environment-specific configurations needed by the application.

For example:

env
Copy code
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.example.com
REACT_APP_OTHER_ENV_VAR=value
Note: The .env file should not be committed to version control if it contains sensitive information. Ensure that team members have the correct .env file for their environment.

4. Run the Application
Start the development server to run the React application locally:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This command starts the development server and opens the application in your default web browser. By default, it should be accessible at:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:3000
5. Building for Production
To create a production build of the application, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
